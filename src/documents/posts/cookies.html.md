##Short story:

We use cookies to support features like login and allow trusted partners to analyse aggregated site usage. Keep cookies enabled to enjoy the full site experience. By browsing our site with cookies enabled, you are agreeing to their use. Review our cookies information for more details.

-----------------------

Memoryous operates under a strict privacy policy. We are committed to being transparent about the technologies we use, and we've outlined below how we use cookies when you visit our site.

##What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small snippet of text that a website asks your browser to store. All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser. Cookies can be removed in two ways: automatically, when they expire, or when you manually delete them. We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies we use.


##Does Memoryous use cookies?

Yes, with the primary purpose to make our website work more effectively.
What kinds of cookies does Memoryous use and why?

We use different kinds of cookies for various reasons:

*Session cookies* - these are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser. We use session cookies to grant access to content and enable commenting (things you have to log in to do).

*Persistent cookies* - these usually have an expiration date far into the future and thus stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them. We use persistent cookies for functionalities like the "Stay logged in" tickbox, which makes it possible for registered users to return to the site without having to log in. We also use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve the site for our customers. This information is anonymised - when we look at the data, in other words, we look at patterns, but we do not see individuals' personally identified information (PII).

## What other cookies might I encounter on Memoryous?

There are also limited third-party cookies on the site. These cookies could be session or persistent and are set by entities other than Memoryous. To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted partners of Memoryous Group. For example, we currently allow:


## What kinds of cookies does Memoryous not use?

We do not use re-targeting cookies and do not use flash cookies (sometimes known as local shared objects or LSOs). We do not allow third-party advertising networks to drop cookies on our site to behaviourally target advertising to our users, either.

## Does Memoryous use any so-called "intrusive" cookies?

No. We don't use re-targeting cookies or flash cookies or any other kind of cookie that can capture personally identifiable information (PII).

##Does Memoryous use cookies to sell customer information?

No.

##How can I delete or disable cookies?

If you want to delete or disable cookies, see [here]( www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies)

##Will the site work if I disable cookies?

You can browse Memoryous with cookies disabled, though some interactions may not work. For example, ticking the “Stay logged in” box at login will not actually keep you logged in to the site unless you have enabled cookies.
