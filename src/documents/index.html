                </h2>
                <p>Whish I knew :). But we can analyze engagement & retention metrics, feedback from users and base product decisions on them. For example, performing cohort analysis, divide customers in segments based on their “time to cancel” (i.e. cancelled after 30 days vs. canceled after more than 30 days) and focus on long-term users who have greater CLV and cancellation reasons we can address. Or we can go with churn models, calculating each customer 'Probability alive'.</p>

                <p>We can discover how each page contributes to conversion. Simple, measurable performance. What are the most valuable pages for conversion? Path analysis, decision trees, and probability theory are your new weapons. We will find which offers you could target at each individual client as he comes back to a certain page. Then plug any hole that leads people away from the desired action.

                <h2>What is the maximum I should pay to acquire customers?</h2>
                <p>Most shops have a 'gut feeling' of what their customer lifetime value (CLV) is, but no way of knowing for sure. Yet this is the number that would make the largest impact to their bottom line, if only it was possible to have it.  Turns out CLV can be computed with surprising accuracy (around 10% error) at the individual level. We'll use sophisticated Bayesian models to estimate CLV. We'll look beyond what has happened in the past (which you get with say Google analytics).</p>
